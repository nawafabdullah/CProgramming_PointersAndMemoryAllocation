Lab 8
=====

The objective for this lab is to investigate order of operations and side effects
in expressions and function calls in C.

The repository contains a collection of C programs: lab8a.c, liab8b.c, and lab8c.c.

Compile each of the programs using the makefile (make all will compile all at once).

Run each of the programs, storing the results in a matching .out file i.e.
    ./lab8a > lab8a.out
    ./lab8b > lab8b.out
    ./lab8c > lab8c.out

There are three C expressions we are interested in, one in each program:
   in lab8a: z = x++ * ++y;
   in lab8b: z = (x++,x) * (++y,y);
   in lab8c: r = p(x++, ++y, f(&z), z/y);

In the file answers.txt, for each of the three expressions listed above, provide a
clear explanation of the precise order in which the operations and side effects must
take place, justifying your explanation based on the output of the three programs.

As always, be sure to add, commit, and push your completed lab.
