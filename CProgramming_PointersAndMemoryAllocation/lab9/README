This README provides the specifications for the lab 9 take home exercise.


Repository contents:

  README - this file
  template.cpp  - example of variadic functions in C++
  lab9.cpp      - empty file for your C++ solution
  varArgs.c     - example of variadic functions in C
  lab9.c        - empty file for your C solution
  makefile - to compile the .cpp and .c files listed

Lab requirements:
-----------------
For this lab you'll be implementing functions that accept a variable number
of parameters in two ways:
  (1) using C stdarg macros (put your solution in lab9.c)
  (2) using C++ templates   (put your solution in lab9.cpp)

An example of each has been provided in the template.cpp and varArgs.c files
  included in the repository, along with a makefile for all four files.

The required behaviour for the variadic functions is as follows:
   you are to implement a variadic PrintLongs function for each,
   that accepts any number of longs as parameters, and prints each
   of its parameters, one per line.

Your lab9.c and lab9.cpp files should each contain a main routine
that illustrates the correct functionality of your PrintLongs,
calling your function at least three different times:
   once with a single value,
   once with two different values,
   once with five different values.


Be sure you have added, committed, and pushed your work as usual.
