Lab 7
=====

The objective for this lab is to investigate data representation, type conversion,
and type casting in C.

The repository contains a collection of C programs: lab7a.c through lab7f.c.

Compile each of the programs using the makefile (make all will compile all at once).

Run each of the programs, storing the results in a matching .out file i.e.
    ./lab7a > lab7a.out
    ./lab7b > lab7b.out
etc

In the file answers.txt, for each program, provide a clear,
intuitive explanation of its behaviour when executed.

As always, be sure to add, commit, and push your completed lab.
