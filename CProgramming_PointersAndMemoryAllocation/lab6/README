Lab 6
=====

The objective for this lab is to investigate variable scopes in C.

One way to narrow down the scope of variables, parameters, and constants
is to identify where they are stored in memory
 - locals typically exist in the stack frame for the current function
 - globals typically exist in the stack space set aside for global variables
 - dynamically created items typically exist in the memory space set aside for the heap

Your task for this lab is
(i)   Alter the program lab6.c to display the memory address of each and every
      constant, variable, and parameter as it runs.  Make sure it also prints
      the address of the memory allocated on the heap (i.e. the address stored
      in the ptr).

(ii)  Compile the program using gcc (not g++), run the program and store the
      results in a file named results.txt

(iii) Provide a written analysis, in file lab6.txt, summarizing which types of
      value appear in which memory areas.  If you notice some areas of memory
      appear to be divided into subsections then make a note of those as well.

As always, be sure to add, commit, and push your solution.
